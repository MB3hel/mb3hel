### <center>Hello ðŸ‘‹</center>


#### About Me

I am a Computer Engineer who enjoys working with both hardware and software. I am particularly passionate about embedded systems and robotics.


#### Cool Projects

[**AUVControlBoard**](https://mb3hel.github.io/AUVControlBoard/) Custom 6 degree of freedom motion controller for underwater robots

[**ArPiRobot Framework**](https://arpirobot.github.io/) Accessible, easy to use robotics framework designed for education, but scalable to complex systems.

<!--[**Arduino-Core-MSP430**]() My (somewhat maintained) fork of the abandoned Energia core for MSP430 MCUs. Allows Arduino code to run on MSP430s. Mostly bugfixes compared to Energia.-->


<!--[**AHT10Driver**](https://github.com/MB3hel/AHT10Driver) MSP430 program demonstrating big-banged (software) I2C communication with an AHT10 temperature / humidity sensor.-->
